# legless-lizard

The backend for a agar.io-esque snake game. Hacked together over a week for fun, not necessarially caring about code quality.

Has some rudimentary bot behavior so that the game is "always-on".

You'll see the game running in docker logs, but can't play it without the frontend!


## Development

List of available make commands can be viewed by simply tying the following
command.

```bash
make
```


## To run the backend
```
make build && make run && make logs
```
